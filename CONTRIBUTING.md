# Contribution Guidelines

*Obs:* If you don`t know how to contribute on github projects check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr6IzOGoMsQ)
*Obs 2:* If you only speak Portuguese, check the [pt-BR](CONTRIBUTING-PT-BR.md).

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- You should have consumed the content you're suggesting.
- The entry should contain the title and author links, first publication year, description and your personal commentary.
  - For the url links for titles, description and authors, use Goodreads, Skoob or Wikipedia. Either is fine, choose the one with the better coverage.
- Use the following format:

```
[title](link) (year) *by [author](link)*

Commentary - [@you](https://github.com/you)

> Description
```

- Check your spelling and grammar.
- The author link should point to the author's [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org) page. If no such page exists, it should point to the author's [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com) or [Skoob](https://www.skoob.com.br/) page. If that doesn't exist either, please leave the author name in plain text instead of a link.
- Please add your name to your commentary, so we know who made it.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- Pull Requests without a personal comment will not be accepted until one is added.
